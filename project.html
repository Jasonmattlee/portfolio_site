<p2> Overview <br><br>Somehow most cloud storage applications manage to be both bland, and overly complex.  Blackbox wants to fix that.  At blackbox, we wanted to create a bold and visually striking platform that could appeal to cool creative people, but we wanted to make it simple enough for any grandma to use.  We also needed that platform to be super secure. We don’t want any hackers stealing grandma’s secret apple pie recipe, or leaking her new mixtape.  Blackbox is cloud storage for cool people, and their cool grandmas. <br><br>Problem<br><br>We were given an assignment to create a cloud storage platform, and not much more than that as far as direction.  It became our job to create a platform that could compete in this crowded marketplace, and maybe disrupt a little bit.  We needed to create a unique and strong identity if we wanted to compete with the market leaders: google, dropbox, etc..</p2>
