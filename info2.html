	<strong>Hi, I'm Jason.</strong><br><br>
<mark>	I’m Chinese and Black, from the Southside of Chicago.</mark>  My mom’s a lesbian and my dad was a marine who had a succesful heart transplant a few years ago.   I’ve always been a bit different, but I’ve come to see my unique perspective, and untraditional background as one of my key strengths.  I love being part of a community and working as part of a team, but I can always be counted on to think a bit differently.
<br><br>
	 <mark>I’ve been living in New York, working as an artist</mark>, supporting myself and showing my art around the world, (<a href="https://artviewer.org/jason-matthew-lee-at-celeste-datacenter/">here’s a show of mine in Paris</a>, <a href="http://www.johanberggren.com/jason-matthew-lee-2/">and another in Malmo</a>) but the more I made objects for rich people to hang on their walls, the more I wanted to create real things. Useful things that people actually use, and that desire led me to product design.  And here we are.  I think <mark>being an artist and studying art  has made me very adept at taking rough conceptual ideas and turning them into engaging products</mark>, and I’m so excited to use these skills in the real world.
<br><br>
	 I think alot about hackers.  Maybe not contemporary hackers so much, but early hackers.    People from the 1980s, and 90s, exploring early computer systems, mostly out of sheer curiosity.  Steve Wozniak (founder of Apple) was a hacker.  He used to make these boxes, called “blue boxes”, that imitated telephone tones which allowed people to make free payphone calls.  Steve Jobs thought these boxes were really cool, and started selling them for Woz, and the rest is history.  Hackers use creativity to break into systems, but they also help to shape them.
<br><br>	TLDR: I’d like to be this for design.
<br><br>
	Frankly, there’s just so much boring design online, and I wonder why.  I think designers have become too dependent on established design systems and conventions. And while these systems are incredibly important, it’s time to think outside of the box, it’s time to hack these systems, and make products that are new and exciting. <mark> I want a world that’s eccentric, and fun, but also accessible and diverse.  I’d really like to help create this world.  Reach out, I’d love to make something with you.</mark>
<br><br>
	In my spare time I love drinking natural wine, and cooking chinese dishes that I remember from my childhood.  My girlfriend does a fashion-line called <a href="https://gauntlettcheng.com/"> Gauntlett Cheng</a>.  <mark>I hope to get a dog someday soon.</mark>
